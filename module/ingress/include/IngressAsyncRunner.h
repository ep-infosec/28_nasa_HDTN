 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This IngressAsyncRunner class is used for launching just the HDTN Ingress module into its own process.
 * The IngressAsyncRunner provides a blocking Run function which creates and
 * initializes an Ingress object by processing/using the various command line arguments.
 * IngressAsyncRunner is only used when running HDTN in distributed mode in which there
 * is a single process dedicated to Ingress.
 * IngressAsyncRunner also provides a signal handler listener to capture Ctrl+C (SIGINT) events
 * for clean termination.
