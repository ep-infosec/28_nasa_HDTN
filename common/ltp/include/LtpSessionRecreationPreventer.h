 *
 * This LtpSessionRecreationPreventer class is used to remember a desired number of
 * the most recent previously received LTP session numbers.
 * It was created during testing of sending large UDP packets with IP fragmentation to
 * help mitigate an anomaly that was seen where old closed session numbers would
 * reappear much later during a multi-session transmission.
